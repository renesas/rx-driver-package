 * @brief Attempts to reserve a lock.

 * @retval true Successful, lock was available and acquired.
 * @retval false Failure, lock was already acquired and is not available.
 * @details This function implements an atomic locking mechanism. Locks can be used in numerous ways. Two common uses
 * of locks are to protect critical sections of code and to protect against duplicate resource allocation.
 * For protecting critical sections of code the user would require that the code first obtain the critical section's
 * lock before executing. An example of protecting against duplicate resource allocation would be if the user had two
 * FIT modules that used the same peripheral. For example, the user may have one FIT module that uses the SCI
 * peripheral in UART mode and another FIT module that uses the SCI peripheral in I2C mode. To make sure that both
 * modules cannot use the same SCI channel, locks can be used.
 * Care should be taken when using locks as they do not provide advanced features one might expect from an RTOS
 * semaphore or mutex. If used improperly locks can lead to deadlock in the user's system.
 * Users can override the default locking mechanisms.

 * @brief Attempts to reserve a hardware peripheral lock.
 * @param[in] hw_index Index of lock to acquire from the hardware lock array.
 * @retval true Successful, lock was available and acquired.
 * @retval false Failure, lock was already acquired and is not available.
 * @details This function attempts to acquire the lock for a hardware resource of the MCU. Instead of sending in a
 * pointer to a lock as with the R_BSP_SoftwareLock() function, the user sends in an index to an array that holds 1
 * lock per MCU hardware resource. This array is shared amongst all FIT modules and user code therefore allowing
 * multiple FIT modules (and user code) to use the same locks. The user can see the available hardware resources by
 * looking at the mcu_lock_t enum in mcu_locks.h. These enum values are also the index into the hardware lock array.
 * The same atomic locking mechanisms from the R_BSP_SoftwareLock() function are used with this function as well.
 * @note Each entry in the mcu_lock_t enum in mcu_locks.h will be allocated a lock. On RX MCUs, each lock is required
 * to be 4-bytes. If RAM space is an issue then the user can remove the entries from the mcu_lock_t enum they are not
 * using. For example, if the user is not using the CRC peripheral then they could delete the BSP_LOCK_CRC entry. The
 * user will save 4-bytes per deleted entry.
